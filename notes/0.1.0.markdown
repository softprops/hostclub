## Initial release

Tired of editing and greping your host file by hand? Me too. Enter hostclub: a tool for managing and inspecting hosts with minimal effort.

## Install

Using [conscript](https://github.com/n8han/conscript#readme), enter the following in your nearest terminal prompt.

    cs softprops/hostclub
    
## Usage

The easist way to get started is to start mapping hosts with `map`

    hc map host ip

List your current managed mappings with  `ls`

    hc ls

Switching between environments? You can bulk map hosts with `swap`

    hc swap previd newip
    
Tired of remembering all those ips? Me too. Enter `alias`

    hc alias qa qaip
    hc alias test testip
    
You can list aliases just as easily.

    hc aliases
    
Now you can issue any command that expects an ip with an alias

    hc swap qa test
    
Finally, save your fingers some typing with (experimental) bash completion

    hc completion >> ~/.bashrc
